- coronavirus.fasta.CAST_thr20_4hackathon.tab
Compositionally biased regions detected by the CAST algorithm (Promponas et al., 2000). 
CAST v2.2 (Ioannides et al., in preparation) tab-separated output, reformatted to be inline with the Swiss-Model annotation format. 
Regions are colored according to amino acid type, following the Rasmol color scheme as described in 
http://life.nthu.edu.tw/~fmhsu/rasframe/SHAPELY.HTM.

- casttab2swmodel.pl

-coronavirus.fasta.CASTV2.2.thr20
