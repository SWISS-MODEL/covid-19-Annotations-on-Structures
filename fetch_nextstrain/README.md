# Fetch variation data from Nextstrain API

First draft script to retrieve and parse the mutations reported in raw data from [Nextstrain](http://data.nextstrain.org/ncov.json). 

I include all the variation data (amino acid and nucleotide) and all the metadata (we could decide later which fields are necessary).

TODO:

- Give format to the output.
- Select the fields of interest.
- Replace protein names with UniProtKB AC
