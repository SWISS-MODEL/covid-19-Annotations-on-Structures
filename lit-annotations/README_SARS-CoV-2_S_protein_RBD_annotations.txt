The following annotations for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein (P0DTC2) come from recent primary literature on the structure and binding interactions. 
The annotations detail key residues which have been highlighted by recent studies as significant for binding interactions with ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies. Annotations from Wan et al. 2020 represent mutations between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 which are deemed adaptive (#DE2DA8) and conserved residues among contact residues in the receptor binding motif of the RBD (#FFA500). Not all conserved sites are included, only those representing suggested contact residues. 
These conserved residues are confirmed by Tai et al. 2020. Additional residues relevant to ACE2 binding (Shang et al. 2020) are highlighted. Key residues with regard to RBD and antibody (CR3022) interactions are highlighted (Yuan et al. 2020)
