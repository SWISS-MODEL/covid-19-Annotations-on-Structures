# Glycosylation of Spike Glycoprotein

The PDB entry of SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein only features truncated glycans (1-2 NAG per N-glycan). In this subproject models with full N-glycans are provided. The models are created using Yasara.
Glycosylation information is take from https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.013276v1

- pdb6vsb_Glycan-A.pdb: A model with tetraantennary N-Glycans on each of the glycosylation sites of chain A that are listed in the above publication. NAG residues that are already present in PDB entry 6vsb have been preserved.
